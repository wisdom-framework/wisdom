= Wisdom Monitor

The Wisdom monitor provides an administration interface letting you know the current status of the Wisdom server and
deployed applications. This interface is modular and can be easily extended with your own 'views'.

== Usage

If you have generated your application with the Maven Wisdom Plugin, the Wisdom Monitor is already deployed. You can
access it from the +Admin+ link (top right of the page). If you have an already existing application, add the
following dependency to the +pom.xml+ file:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>wisdom-monitor</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

If you application is already running, just copy the jar file to the +application+ directory.

Once deployed and running, the monitor is available from: http://localhost:9000/monitor. The default credentials are:
 _admin/admin_ (yes it's pretty original).

== Overview

The main navigation menu is on the left side of the page. You can logout at any time from the top menu.

=== The Dashboard

Once logged in you access the 'Dashboard' view giving you an overview of your system. The dashboard displays live
data thanks to a web socket.

The first part of the dashboard view monitors the CPU usage, and the state of the threads. On the right side you have
 information about the Garbage Collection and the JVM uptime.

The thread dump button provides the stack traces of all currently existing threads:

Below you find the health checks. Health checks are sensors exposed by your application indicating in which state
your application is running.All exposed health checks are displayed there. By default, there are no health check (see
 below to implement one).

Finally the bottom of the page contains the HTTP metrics such as the number of active request, and the ratio per
status of the served requests.

=== Wisdom - Loggers

The 'loggers' view let you configure the level of the loggers used by Wisdom and you applications.

=== Wisdom - Routes

The 'routes' view let you know what are the currently exposed routes, their HTTP method, URI and the name of the
action method handling the request.

=== OSGi - iPOJO

The 'iPOJO' view gives you details about the http://ipojo.org[iPOJO] instances, their factories and the available
handlers. It also provides a dump of the current state useful to debug +INVALID+ instances.

The top of the page provides you sensible indicator about the states. 'STOPPED' instances is generally a bad signal
(an instance has crashed).

=== OSGi - Bundles

The 'Bundles' view provides details about the deployed OSGi bundles. It also let you start, stop, update and uninstall
them.

=== OSGi - Services

The 'Services' view list the published services and their properties.

=== OSGi - Shell

The 'Shell' view let you access the OSGi _Shelbie_ shell. Useful commands are:

* +lb+ : list bundles
* +instances+ : list iPOJO instances
* +instance name+ : dump the architecture of the instance having the given name
* +start url+: installs and starts the bundle (downloading it from the given url)
* +update id+: update the given bundle (bundle id)
* +inspect c service id+: dump the services exposed by the given bundle (bundle id)
* +inspect r service id+: dump the services consumed by the given bundle (bundle id)
* +inspect c osgi.wiring.package id+: dump the package provided by the given bundle (bundle id)
* +inspect r osgi.wiring.package id+: dump the package required by the given bundle (bundle id)

== Configuring the Wisdom Monitor

You can configure the Wisdom Monitor from the +application.conf+ file:

----
##
# Enables or disables the HTTP monitoring, enabled by default
##
monitor.http.enabled = true

##
# Enables or disables the exposition of the metrics on JMX, enabled by default.
# It uses the platform MBEAN server.
##
monitor.jmx.enabled = true

##
# Enables or disables the authentication
##
monitor.auth.enabled = true

##
# The authentication credentials. Consider configuring them using system variables:
# -Dmonitor.auth.username=admin -Dmonitor.auth.password=admin
##
monitor.auth.username = admin
monitor.auth.password = admin

##
# Configures the graphite support (disabled by default). When enabled, the metrics are
# sent to the configured Graphite server.
##
monitor.graphite.enabled = false
monitor.graphite.host = ...
monitor.graphite.port = ...

##
# Configures the default view (dashboard by default).
##
monitor.default = dashboard

##
# Configures the update period in the dashboard in second (10s by default).
##
monitor.period = 10

##
# The HTTP metrics relies on a Wisdom interceptor. You can configure the intercepted
# urls using the following property. By default all requests are intercepted.
#
# In addition, you can configure the interceptor priority (10000 by default).
##
monitor.http.interception = .*
monitor.http.priority = 10000

== Adding Health Checks

Health checks are sensors implemented by your application indicating its current state. To provide a health check,
just implement the +org.wisdom.monitor.service.HealthCheck+ interface and expose it as a service:

[source, java]
----
@Controller
// or @Component @Provides @Instantiate
public class MyHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public String name() {
        return "my state";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean check() throws Exception {
        return 1 + 1 == 2;
    }
}
----

The `name` method specifies hte health check name.

The `check` method can:

1. return `true` to indicate that everything is fine
2. return `false` to indicate an issue
3. throws an exception indicating an issue and attaching this exception to the health check

== Extending the Wisdom Monitor

The Wisdom Monitor is extensible. Every extension must:

1. provides a controller extending +org.wisdom.monitor.service.MonitorExtension+ and secured using
+@Authenticated("Monitor-Authenticator")+
2. provides a page using a template _extending_ the +monitor/layout+ thymeleaf template.

Every view of the Wisdom Monitor follows these conventions. Of course, these extensions don't have to be in the
Wisdom Monitor jar file.


[source, java]
----
@Controller
@Authenticated("Monitor-Authenticator")
public class LoggerExtension extends DefaultController implements MonitorExtension {

    // A template extending the Wisdom Monitor Layout
    @View("monitor/loggers")
    Template template;

    // A route serving the view page
    @Route(method = HttpMethod.GET, uri = "/monitor/logs")
    public Result index() {
        return ok(render(template));
    }

    // Two routes handling the view requests
    @Route(method = HttpMethod.GET, uri = "/monitor/logs/loggers")
    public Result loggers() {
        //...
    }


    @Route(method = HttpMethod.PUT, uri = "/monitor/logs/{name}")
    public Result setLevel(@Parameter("name") String loggerName, @Parameter("level") String level) {
        //...
    }

    // The three method required to be a Monitor Extension

    // The menu label
    @Override
    public String label() {
        return "Loggers";
    }

    // The url of the page
    @Override
    public String url() {
        return "/monitor/logs";
    }

    // The category (to structure the menu)
    @Override
    public String category() {
        return "Wisdom";
    }
}
----

As stated, the template use by the extension must 'extend' the +/monitor/layout+ template, as follows:

[source, xml]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html layout:decorator="layout"> <!-- notice the decorator -->
<head lang="en">
    <!-- your extension title -->
    <title>Logback Loggers</title>

    <!-- additional styles and scripts -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/table.css"/>

    <!-- Important to add if you want a look and feel similar to the other extensions -->
    <link href="/assets/dashboard.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
</head>
<body>
<!-- the content of your view (the main content) -->
<div layout:fragment="content">

    <!-- the actual content goes there -->
    <h1 class="page-header">Loggers</h1>

    <!-- ... -->
</div>
</body>
</html>
----

The layout embeds Jquery and Bootstrap (version 3).

The path to the "layout" main template must follows the Thymeleaf convention. So if your template is in the +monitor+
 directory +layout+ is enough. If you are in +view/monitor/+ then +../layout+ is required.
