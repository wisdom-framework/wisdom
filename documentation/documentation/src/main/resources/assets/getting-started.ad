== Getting started

=== Installing Wisdom

==== Prerequisites
To run Wisdom, you need:

1. Java 7+ (Java Development Kit)
2. http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven]. Wisdom requires a recent version of Maven (3.2.1+)

In production, Wisdom just requires the Java 7+ virtual machine.

TIP: Java 8 is also supported. So you can use lambda expressions !

=== Nothing to install ?

You don't need to install anything ? The Wisdom build process will download everything.
