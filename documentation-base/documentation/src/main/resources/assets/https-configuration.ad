== Configuring HTTPS

Wisdom can be configured to serve HTTPS. To enable this, simply tell Wisdom which port to listen to using the +https.port+
system property. For example:

[source, shell]
----
export JVM_ARGS="-Dhttps.port=9005"
./chameleon.sh start
----

The +https.port+ property can also be written in the application configuration file.

=== SSL Certificates
By default, Wisdom generates itself a self signed certificate, however typically this will not be suitable for
serving a website in production. Wisdom uses Java key stores to configure SSL certificates and keys.

Signing authorities often provide instructions on how to create a Java keystore (typically with reference to Tomcat
configuration). The official Oracle documentation on how to generate keystores using the JDK keytool utility can be
found http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html[here].

Having created your keystore, the following *system properties* can be used to configure Wisdom to use it:

* +https.keyStore+: The path to the keystore containing the private key and certificate,
if not provided generates a keystore for you
* +https.keyStoreType+: The key store type, defaults to JKS
* +https.keyStorePassword+: The password, defaults to a blank password
* +https.keyStoreAlgorithm+: The key store algorithm, defaults to the platforms default algorithm

=== Turning HTTP off
To disable binding on the HTTP port, set the +http.port+ system property to be +-1+, eg:

[source, shell]
----
export JVM_ARGS="-Dhttp.port=-1 -Dhttps.port=9005 -Dhttps.keyStore=/path/to/keystore -Dhttps.keyStorePassword=pwd"
./chameleon.sh start
----

The +http.port+ property can also be written in the application configuration file, and as a consequence,
HTTP can be disabled from the application configuration file.
