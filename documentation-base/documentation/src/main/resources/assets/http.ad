== HTTP Programming

=== Actions, Controllers and Results

==== What is an Action?
Most of the requests received by a Wisdom application are handled by an _action_. An action is basically a Java
method that processes the received request parameters, and produces a +Result+ to be sent to the client.

----
@Route(method = HttpMethod.POST, uri = "/")
public Result index() {
    return ok("Got request " + request() + "!");
}
----

An action returns a +org.wisdom.api.http.Result+ value, representing the HTTP response to send to the
web client. In this example ok constructs a +OK+ (HTTP Code 200) response containing a _text/plain_ response body.

Actions are declared with the +org.wisdom.api.annotations.Route+ annotation (+@Route+) indicating the
HTTP method and _uri_ used to invoke the action.

==== Controllers
Controllers are Wisdom components containing the application logic. A controller is nothing more than a class
annotated with the +org.wisdom.api.annotations.Controller+ (+@Controller+) that groups several action
methods.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/controllers/Simple.java[tags=controller]
----

The simplest syntax for defining an action is a (non-static) method with no parameters that returns a +Result+ value,
as shown above.

An action method can also have parameters:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/controllers/Name.java[tags=controller]
----

These parameters (indicated with the +@Parameter+ annotation) will be resolved by Wisdom and will be filled with
values from the request. The parameter values can be extracted from either the URL path or the URL query. The
annotation value, +"name"+ in the previous example, indicates the name of the parameter.

==== Results
Let’s start with basic results: an HTTP result with a status code, a set of HTTP headers and a body to be sent to the
 client. These results are defined by +org.wisdom.api.http.Result+, and the
 +org.wisdom.api.http.Results+ class provides several helpers to produce standard HTTP results,
 such as the +ok+ method we used in the previous examples:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/controllers/Simple.java[tags=controller]
----

Here are several examples that create various results:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/controllers/ResultExample.java[tags=results]
----

All of these helpers can be found in the +org.wisdom.api.http.Results+ class.

==== Redirects are simple results too
Redirecting the browser to a new URL is just another kind of simple result. However,
these result types don’t have a response body.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/controllers/Redirect.java[tags=redirect]
----

The default is to use a 303 SEE_OTHER response type, but you can also specify a more specific status code:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/controllers/Redirect.java[tags=temporary-redirect]
----

=== Response encoding

Wisdom can encode automatically response content according to the client +Accept_Encoding+ header. The default behavior
is to automatically encode all traffic which has a size between 1KB and 10MB. Encoders currently available are +gzip+ and +deflate+

==== Activate / Deactivate encoding

You can disable encoding globally by setting the key +encoding.global+ to false in the configuration file.

Wisdom also provides 2 annotations allowing you to finely tune encoding behaviors. 

* +@DenyEncoding+ can be used to disable encoding on +Controllers+ and +Routes+ ;
* +@AllowEncoding+ can be used to enable encoding on +Controllers+ and +Routes+.

In case  of multiple instructions, priority is as follow : +Route+ > +Method+ > +Configuration+.

==== Control encoding activation size

By default, Wisdom encodes content whose size is between 1KB and 10MB. If you want a different behavior, you can tune 
theses values with : 

* +encoding.max.size+ and +encoding.min.size+ configuration keys (long value in bytes)
* +@AllowEncoding+  +maxSize+ and +minSize+ parameters (long value in bytes)

==== MimeType filtering

By default already encoded MimeTypes are not encoded by Wisdom. This includes +audio/+, +video/+, +image/+ MimeType groups
as well as all common compressed MimeType (+7z+, +rar+, ...)

==== URL encoding

Content whose size can't be found by Wisdom is not encoded, for performance reasons. Thus +Stream+ contents
are not encoded.

We have an exception for +URL+, as we are able to determine MimeType. By default, URL content are encoded
but you can deactivate it by the global configuration key +encoding.url+. Setting this key to +false+ will
disable +URL+ content encoding (this include +assets+ and +resources+).

If you want to deactivate URL content encoding on a particular +Route+ or +Controller+, you can still use @DenyEncoding to not encode
URL returned by theses routes.
