== Content negotiation

Content negotiation is a mechanism that makes it possible to serve different representation of a same resource (URI).
 It is useful e.g. for writing Web Services supporting several output formats (XML, JSON, etc.). Server-driven
 negotiation is essentially performed using the +Accept*+ requests headers. You can find more information on content
 negotiation in the HTTP specification.

=== Language
You can get the list of acceptable languages for a request using the +request().languages()+ method that
retrieves them from the +Accept-Language+ header and sorts them according to their quality value. The return array
of locale is sorted from the most 'wanted' language to the less 'wanted' one.

=== Content
Similarly, the +request().mediaTypes()+ method gives the list of acceptable resultâ€™s MIME types for a
request. It retrieves them from the +Accept+ request header and sorts them according to their quality factor.

The _most_ preferred type can be retrieved using +request().mediaType()+. In addition, you can test if a
given MIME type is acceptable for the current request using the +request().accepts()+ method:

----
public Result list() {
  if (request().accepts("text/html")) {
    return ok(result).html();
  } else {
    return ok(result).json();
  }
}
----
